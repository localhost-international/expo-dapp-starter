# Expo DApp Starter
> Expo, React Native, TypeScript, Hardhat and Ethers


## What is this?

A starter kit/boilerplate for building:

1. an integrated wallet/dapp (web3 provider and dapp)
2. a WalletConnect compatible dapp (soon)

...with:

* Expo (React Native)
	* TypeScript
	* Ethers (web3 provider)
	* Styled Components
* Hardhat
	* Solidity
	* Ethers


## How does it work?

Run the native app:

* `yarn`
* `expo start`

Run the local node/deploy contracts:

* `TODO`
